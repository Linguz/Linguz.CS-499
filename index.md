# Carlos A Martinez's CS 499 Final Project

## Code Review

This [code review](https://youtu.be/rnRD6E8ajY4) is of the software design & engineering work, and two works from algorithms and databases that I ended up not using. 

## Polished Works & Narratives

### Software Design & Engineering

	The artifact that I selected was from CS-330, working with Microsoft Visual Studios and creating three dimensional objects. It was created in the last semester, so very recently, and it is a three dimensional representation of how my living room shelf once was. The inclusion of this artifact in my ePortfolio is to demonstrate my ability to create 3D objects using points and code (instead of a program). The specific component that showcases my skills is how you are able to manipulate the camera to look at the shapes in any direction. I improved the artifact mostly by making it more readable within the code. 

	While I met most of the objectives I planned, there is one objective I will need to further improve to get this artifact to the point that I want it to be at. I need to learn how to create and read shader files better, as I am sure that is the cause of the lack of textures on my 3D models. While I was updating the artifact, I came upon an issue where I had to reduce the changes I wanted to make. I had wanted to turn an entire block of code into a formula instead, but it would require sending a dozen variables or moving variables to make them global variables. When I go back to this project to work on it for the final, I will be returning to that idea and seeing if turning the variables into global variables works as well as I hope it does. 

### Algorithms & Data Structures

	The artifact that I selected was to actually create a brand new program, with the intent that this is something I have wanted to make for a while and this is as good an excuse to create it as any other. This program is actually a combination of two programs, one ran first and the other ran second. The first program takes dirty HTML (currently manually acquired) and scrapes out all the links, leaving nothing else. The second program takes a look at those links, goes to that website, and gets a specific line of HTML from their source code. Currently the code has some shorthands and bad variable names that I would like to change. To quickly see the program work, first run ‘textCleaner.py’ to generate the ‘cleanText.txt’ file, then run ‘webScraper.py’ and follow the directions to run a QuickScan. A good item slot to look for is ‘None’, as there are a large amount of slotless items in the first one hundred entries. This program also requires internet to function, as one might expect. 
	
	Eventually, I will be integrating a SQL system as well which will be the primary searching area instead of connecting to the website every time. This, however, is will be done over the next few weeks. 

### Databases

	The artifact that I selected was to actually create a brand new program, with the intent that this is something I have wanted to make for a while and this is as good an excuse to create it as any other. This program is intended to work side by side with Milestone Three’s program, but does not yet have any functionality that allows it to do so. This program is currently more a prototype, in that the information is currently hardcoded into it. Eventually, I wish to have it receive information from ‘webScraper.py’ and store said information to later be accessed by a searching tool. This artifact will show my proficiency with databases, specifically creating, updating, and searching through them. 
	
	The intent of this artifact is to limit the amount of times the website needs to be reached, such that they do not flag the user as a potential threat (leading to an IP ban) and allowing significantly faster scans of items as you would not need to wait for it to check the website.
